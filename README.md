## Dataset

The dataset contains information about The Ford GoBike System data which includes information about individual rides made in a bike sharing system covering the greater San Francisco Bay area. The dataset features 183412 rows and 17 columns and the columns were extended to 31 columns to provide room for more insightful variables which helped the investigation while the rows were pruned to 173272 rows after cleaning.

## Summary of Findings

From my investigation, the following are the summary of my findings:

- The mean age of the users is approximately 36 while the mode is 34

- There are more male users than female user

- From the user type, there are more subscribers than customers

- Most of the trips were not shared ride

- Thursday is the day of the week for most trips.

- The 7th week of the year saw the most trips for that period

- Most rides happened at the 8th and 17th hour of each day.

- Majority of users across all age bracket rode for an average of 200 minutes

- The 50% percentile of the age of gender of users falls between 34 - 37

- The 50% percentile of the age of each category of users is 35

- Subscribers travel for shorter distance, shorter period of time but at a faster speed

- Customers travel for longer distance, longer period of time but at a slower speed

- Subscribers are more active between Monday to Friday while the customers are more active on Saturdays and Sundays.


## Key Insights for Presentation

For the presentation, attention was focused on:

- The relationship between the distance, duration and speed for each category of users in order to determine their lifestyle

- The number of rides per hour of the day and day of the week

- The active days for each category of users
